# XDen
I seek to create a fully decentralized and distributed P2P database. It's been a decade since the last major milestone of P2P - Kademlia. 

XDen is coded in the Go programming language, a concise compiled language that offers really nice concurrency constructs. 

XDen is based on the Kademlia DHT. It's important to state though, XDen isn't a DHT. It's built for mutable data.
