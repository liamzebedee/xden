# XDen
I seek to create a fully decentralized and distributed P2P database. It's been a decade since the last major milestone of P2P - Kademlia. 

XDen is coded in the Go programming language, a concise compiled language that offers really nice concurrency constructs. 

XDen is based on the Kademlia DHT. It's important to state though, XDen isn't a DHT. It's built for mutable data. 

## Get involved
To become involved, just go to the issues page of this repository. Development is done in the /development branch, which is frequently updated. When XDen reaches a somewhat stable compilation level (that is, tests can run) data will be pushed to /master.

Make sure to read up on the [design doc](https://github.com/liamzebedee/xden/wiki/Design). If you want some extra info, just contact me, liamzebedee.
